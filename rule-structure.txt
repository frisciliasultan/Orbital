A function takes in a modPlan and a params object from a rule and returns a boolean of whether
the modPlan fulfills the rule given or not

A rule is an implementation of a function. Without the rule, the function lacks inputs for its
parameters and cannot be used to evaluate a modPlan.

The complile function is used to construct a working function by combining the inputs from a 
rule with the appropriate function in the library.
